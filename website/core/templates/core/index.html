  <h2>About the Game</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the 'Schlangenprogrammiernacht', a programming game initially developed for <a href="https://entropia.de/GPN19">GPN19</a>. This is the „official“ server for the GPN20.
  </p>

  <p>Program your own snake’s behaviour, eat as much as you can and try not to die. Remember: always keep a healthy distance to other snakes!</p>

  <p>Everybody is invited to join! Simply <a href="{% url 'signup' %}">create an account</a> and start coding.</p>

  <p>If you never played SPN before, you may want to watch the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn18-153-einfhrung-schlangenprogrammiernacht-2018">Introduction Talk at GPN18</a> and the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn19-70-schlangenprogrammiernacht-2-0">presentation of version 2 at GPN19</a> (both in German).

  <h2>About this Server</h2>

  <p>This game is running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB RAM. The CPU clock is fixed to the maximum frequency (1.5 GHz) for consistent timing.</p>

  <p>Head over to the <a href="https://stats.tkolb.de/grafana/d/Bv5ZRWMWz/">Grafana Dashboard</a> for gameserver statistics.</p>

  <h2>Get the Code!</h2>

  <p>The SPN server is Free Software! Get the code <a href="https://github.com/schlangenprogrammiernacht/spn-meta">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>What’s new?</h2>

  <p>Most important new feature: the game can now be played in <em>different programming languages</em>! So far, we have frameworks for <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong>!

  <p>Otherwise, we are using the same parameters as on the rC3 2021:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Very few „static“ food items.
    <li>Food decays very slowly.
    <li>Boosting is very effective (3x speed), but also quite expensive (3 ‰ mass per frame).
  </ul>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
