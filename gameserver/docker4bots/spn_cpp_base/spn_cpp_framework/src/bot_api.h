 * The main purpose of this class is to abstract away the layout details of the
 * shared memory used to interface with the gameserver. Methods are provided to
 * extract relevant data from the shared memory and the movement parameters for
 * the current frame can be easily set using public member variables.
 *
 * Most methods return pointers pointing into the shared memory to minimize the
 * overhead. The returned structures are described in ipc_format.h .
