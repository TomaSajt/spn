 * \section Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the SPN bot framework documentation.
 *
 * For a quick overview, we recommend to take a look at the Api class and move
 * through the different IPC structures from there.
 *
 * This framework is a very thin abstraction layer between your code and the
 * shared memory used for fast communication with the gameserver.
